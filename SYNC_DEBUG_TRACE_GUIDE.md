# Sync Page Debug Trace Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive console tracing has been added to the Sync Golden Records page to help identify issues with the sync functionality.

## Trace Message Format

All trace messages follow this pattern:
```
[TRACE] {emoji} {message}
```

### Emojis Legend
- üîµ = Button click event
- üü¢ = Function entry (syncAllRecords)
- üü£ = Function entry (performSyncAll)
- üé¨ = Component lifecycle
- üì§ = HTTP request preparation
- üöÄ = HTTP request sent
- üì• = HTTP response received
- ‚úÖ = Success / Confirmation
- ‚ùå = Error / Failure / Cancellation
- üü° = Modal / UI action
- üèÅ = Function completion
- ‚úì = Step completed

## Trace Flow

### 1. Component Initialization
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Navigate to Sync Golden Records page
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Clear console (Ctrl+L or Cmd+K)

### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue
1. Click "Sync All Records" button
2. Observe the trace messages in console

### Step 3: Analyze the Output

#### Check Component Initialization
- Are golden records loaded? Should see count > 0
- Are sync rules loaded? Should see count > 0
- Are there active rules? Check the rule details

#### Check Button Click
- Does the button click register?
- What's the current state when clicked?
- Are systems selected?

#### Check Sync Validation
- Does syncAllRecords() start?
- Are active records found?
- Are active rules found?
- Does the confirmation modal open?
- Does user confirm?

#### Check Sync Execution
- Does performSyncAll() start?
- Does isSyncing become TRUE?
- Is the modal visible?
- Does the 500ms delay complete?

#### Check HTTP Requests
- Is the HTTP request prepared correctly?
- Is the payload correct?
- Is the request actually sent?
- Is a response received?
- What's the response content?
- How long did it take?

#### Check Completion
- Does the FINALLY block execute?
- Are the completion flags set?
- Does the modal close after 2 seconds?

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Button Click Not Registering
**Symptoms:**
- No "[TRACE] üîµ SYNC BUTTON CLICKED" message

**Possible Causes:**
- Button is disabled
- Event binding not working
- JavaScript error preventing execution

**Check:**
- Button disabled state in trace
- Any errors before button click

### Issue 2: No Active Rules
**Symptoms:**
- "[TRACE] ‚ùå No active sync rules found"

**Solution:**
1. Go to "Sync Rules" tab
2. Create a sync rule
3. Toggle it to active (green)

### Issue 3: Modal Not Showing
**Symptoms:**
- isSyncing is TRUE but modal not visible
- No visual feedback

**Check:**
- "[TRACE] Modal visibility flags" output
- Browser console for CSS/rendering errors
- Component template binding issues

### Issue 4: HTTP Request Fails
**Symptoms:**
- Request sent but error in response
- No response received

**Check:**
- Backend server running on port 3000
- Network tab in DevTools
- Backend console logs
- API endpoint correct

### Issue 5: Sync Completes But No Records Synced
**Symptoms:**
- HTTP response shows 0 synced records
- No errors

**Check:**
- Sync rule criteria (country, city, etc.)
- Number of records matching the rule
- Backend filtering logic
- Golden records status (must be "Active")

## Backend Logs to Check

Backend also has extensive logging. Check backend console for:
```
[SYNC] Execute sync for {system}
[SYNC] Received {count} record IDs
[SYNC] Found rule: {ruleName}
[SYNC] Rule criteria: {JSON}
[SYNC] Applying condition: {field} {operator} {value}
[SYNC] Final query: {SQL}
[SYNC] Found {count} records matching criteria for {system}
[SYNC] Syncing records for {system}:
  - {companyName} ({country}, {type})
[SYNC] ‚úì Synced: {companyName} to {system}
[SYNC] Operation {id} for {system} completed: {synced}/{total} synced
```

================================================================================

[TRACE] Setting isSyncing to TRUE
[TRACE] Processing system 1/3: Oracle Forms
[TRACE] üöÄ Sending HTTP POST to http://localhost:3000/api/sync/execute-selected
[TRACE] üì• HTTP Response received in 234ms

... (repeat for each system)
[TRACE] üèÅ performSyncAll() FINISHED
```

## Tips
1. **Use Console Filters**: Filter by "[TRACE]" to see only trace messages
2. **Check Timestamps**: Verify operations complete in reasonable time
3. **Watch Network Tab**: Verify HTTP requests are actually sent
4. **Compare Backend Logs**: Cross-reference frontend and backend logs
5. **Test Incrementally**: Test with 1 system first, then multiple
